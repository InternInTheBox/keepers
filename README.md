As stated before, I am not sure how much of this is necessary for it to run correctly.  I downloaded framework7 and phoneGap desktop application.  Through phoneGap I created the following.  It started from a framework7 template.  The pertinent files which I edited can be found in the www folder, and are about.html, index.html, and Sheets.html.  I would recommend looking around briefly to see what is actually necessary for the program to run correctly.  I do suggest having phoneGap desktop installed, and hosting the project through there so that it can be used on an android phone.  In order to use it on an android phone, please install phoneGap on your android device as well, and type in the address highlighted in green at the bottom of your phoneGap desktop app.  If you go through those steps, you can actually just take the html files I gave you and put them in your www folder (as shown), and the program should run as it was given.  I did a lot of in line commenting so hopefully that will be enough.  Feel free to email me with direct questions as to functionality and running of the code.
